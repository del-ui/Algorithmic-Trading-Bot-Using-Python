### Prerequisites/ Requirements

The main prerequisite for this tutorial is the basic knowledge of python
and its algorithms. For the matter of testing, We will use **QUANTCONNECT** which 
lean engine to integrate your code with the trading site.
That means you don't actually require an offline editor since the site provides
its own editor.


### How to develop the Trading Bot

With you prerequisites and requirements ready, you can now code along for
a practical understanding.
Go to https//: www.quantconnect.com to setup your coding environment. You can 
also use an offline editor and upload the code later for testing.

Let's get started...

### Developing/ coding it out.
We are going the develop it stepwise. Follow the steps below;
